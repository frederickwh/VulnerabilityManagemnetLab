<h1>Creating a Vulnerability Management Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I proudly showcase a project that demonstrates my expertise in building a Vulnerability Management Lab from the ground up. This project highlights my ability to leverage cutting-edge tools and technologies. I utilized Nessus Essentials, a renowned vulnerability scanning tool, and VMware Workstation to create a secure and controlled lab environment. Inside the lab, I configured a Windows 10 Virtual Machine. The Virtual Machine served as a target for vulnerability assessment. To simulate real-world scenarios, I installed outdated and deprecated software within the Windows 10 VM. This step added an extra layer of authenticity to the lab by mimicking the challenges organizations face with legacy systems. Using Nessus Essentials, I meticulously conducted vulnerability scans against the Windows 10 Virtual Machine, uncovering a range of vulnerabilities that might be lurking within the system. These vulnerabilities were categorized and assessed based on their severity. To gain deeper insights, I took a hands-on approach. I remediated some of the identified vulnerabilities, closely observing the changes in the system's security posture. This step allowed me to gain practical experience in vulnerability management and mitigation.

<h2>Experience</h2>

</b>Performed the following tasks:</b>
- Installed and configured Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scans against Windows 10 Hosts.
- Implemented Vulnerability Management Function on sandbox networks: Discover, Prioritize, Assess, Report, Remediate, Verify.
- Conducted vulnerability assessments with Nessus; remediated vulnerabilities.
- Developed automated remediation process to preemptively deal with vulnerabilities stemming from Windows updates and third-party software.

<h2>Exposure:</h2>

- Nessus Essentials
- Virtualization (VMware Workstation Pro)
- Vulnerability Remediation
